# Retail Data Analysis

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of large-scale retail data using Python. The primary focus is on extracting actionable insights to enhance business strategies and decision-making processes.

## Project Overview

The project involves:

- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and preparing the dataset for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Uncovering patterns, trends, and relationships within the data.
- **Visualization**: Creating informative plots to illustrate key findings.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Applying statistical methods to validate hypotheses and derive conclusions.

## Key Components

- **Data Preprocessing**: Scripts and functions to clean and preprocess raw retail data.
- **Analysis Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks detailing each step of the analysis with code and explanations.
- **Visualizations**: Graphs and charts generated during the analysis to support findings.

## Getting Started
